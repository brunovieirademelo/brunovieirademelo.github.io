This section is currently under construction.

I spend my free time interchangeably around:

- Birdwatching — Although we hear more than see…
- Boardgames — *Tigris & Euphrates* (1997) would be a good starting point.
- Formula 1 — Yes, Lewis Hamilton should have won in Abu Dhabi 2021.
- Linguistics — proficient in Portuguese (pt) and English (en); independent in Spanish (es), French (fr) and German (de).
- Photography — there's always more than meets the eye.
- Sci-Fi — any!
